=== GameWorld

=== Voxel World
The voxelworld the world which is visible to the player. It is a subset of the GameWorld.
The the game does effort to keep the voxelworld near to the center coordinates to prevent floating point errors.
To achive this it offsets objects from the game world to the voxel world to keep the player near the center (origin).


Everything that exists in the voxel world is send to bevy to render it.

It can also load chunks from multiple Dimensions to not have to recrate the voxel world when the player moves between dimensions.
